        Oh the Week. How rough it has been. Personally, i came up with a work flow, i really did<br>
        The weekends I dedicate time to the writing and reading assignments for the upcoming week<br>
        So come Monday I'am somewhat prepared and know what Thomas is talking about.<br>
        I know I am defintely outside my comfort zone here, but if i can figure out how to file taxes
        surely this is a piece of cake. Wrong. So here is what i did to Fake it til I make it through this week.

      I Wasnt able to watch all the class videos fully , so what i did was take the directions 
      from the lab assignments and I youtubed a specific instruction on how to do it . From W3 schools and youtube 
      I was able to jot down hand written notes for memory and better understanding of what to do.
